# **🧠 CORE PROMPTS FOR INSIGHT EXTRACTION**

---

## **🔹 1\. Customer Feedback Synthesis**

### **📜 Prompt**

```markdown
You are a product marketer trained in customer research.

Analyze the following raw customer feedback (support tickets, survey responses, call summaries, reviews). Identify and summarize:

- The top 3 pain points mentioned
- Common emotions or frustrations expressed
- Any recurring feature requests or improvement suggestions
- Read between the lines and uncover any unspoken or unwritten thoughts

Then output a short insight memo for the GTM team, using bullet points and plain language.
```

### **💬 Why This Works**

- Turns anecdotal signals into digestible GTM intel  
- Anchors messaging in real pain points  
- Easy to repackage into roadmap input or marketing copy

### **🛠️ How to Experiment**

- Ask for tone analysis: “What’s the underlying sentiment in this feedback?”
- Add “What language patterns suggest urgency or risk?”
- Chain with a second prompt: “Write 3 value props that respond to the above pain points.”

## **🔹 2\. Sales Call Transcript Analyzer**

### **📜 Prompt**

```markdown
You are a sales strategist reviewing this transcript from a recent sales call.

Your task is to extract:

- 3 buyer pain points or objections
- 2 positive signals or buying triggers
- 1 quote that reflects the buyer’s mindset

Then suggest how to adjust our pitch or follow-up strategy based on what you’ve learned.
```

### **💬 Why This Works**

- Captures language straight from the buyer’s mouth  
- Surfaces friction and opportunity in the same analysis  
- Makes feedback loops easy for founders or GTM leads

### **🛠️ How to Experiment**

- Add: “Suggest 1 question we should have asked but didn’t.”

## **🔹 3\. Competitor Positioning Decoder**

### **📜 Prompt**

```markdown
You are a competitive intelligence analyst.

Visit this competitor’s website (or review the pasted content) and answer:

- What are the top 3 themes in their messaging?
- What buyer persona are they targeting?
- What pain points do they emphasize?
- What’s the tone and brand voice?

Then write a short positioning summary that outlines how they want to be perceived.
```

### **💬 Why This Works**

- Breaks down “fuzzy” marketing into structured components  
- Helps refine your differentiation angle  
- Surfaces how competitors frame value to the same audience

### **🛠️ How to Experiment**

Output in bullet format with plain-language headlines.
```

### **💬 Why This Works**

# **📈 How to Get the Most From This Pack**

- **Use real data**: Paste actual reviews, transcripts, or competitor pages — not generic blurbs.
- **Chain prompts**: Start with one (extract insights), then feed into a second (write value prop).
- **Mix formats**: Tables, memos, bullet lists — all help make output more usable.
