## **🔹 1\. Pre-Call Preparation Battlecard**

### **📜 Prompt**

```markdown
You are a top-performing sales development representative.
I am preparing for a meeting with {Prospect Name}, {Job Title at Company}.
Based on the information provided below (LinkedIn bio, company website, news articles), do the following:

- Summarize the top 3 likely pain points they face.
- Identify 2 insightful discovery questions I can ask during the call.
- Highlight 1 industry trend or company milestone I can mention to show relevance.

Use a professional, consultative tone in your output.
```

### **💬 Why This Works**

* Buyers appreciate when you show you understand them *before* the call even starts.

* It turns scattered research into a focused conversation plan.

* Asking better questions makes you stand out as a serious, prepared partner.

### **🛠️ How to Experiment**

* Try **swapping the tone**: warm and casual for startup founders; formal and sharp for enterprise.

* **Request 3 versions**: a conservative prep sheet, a creative version, and a “risky” version.

* Add a line asking for a **"cold open hook"** to kick off the meeting.

## **🔹 2\. Post-Meeting Follow-Up Email (Selling With Framework)**

### **📜 Prompt**

```markdown

You are an expert salesperson. I will give you meeting notes of the interaction and context about my company below. Review those carefully and then help me craft a follow-up email that makes it easy for my buyer to forward the email internally and build consensus toward buying my product.

--- Here is information about my company for context ---

###Problem Statement###
{Problem Statement}
###Solution Statement###
{Solution Statement}
###Target Audience###

--- Here are notes from the meeting with the prospect --- 

{Paste your notes here}

--- Instructions --- 

I want to send a follow-up "problem statement" with "cost and consequences" to continue my discussions with this prospect. 

Refer to Nate Nasrella's "Selling With" for crafting problem statements, like this: "despite trying [failed solution], we still can't [desired outcome], because of [this problem], caused by [root cause]."

Nate recommends this framing: "Here's the formula: 'every [frequency], at least [reach] our [pain], costing us [loss].' With consequences stated as 'that means [implication #1]. If it's not addressed by [timeline], then [implication #2].' 
Reach is how many people are impacted. 
Frequency is how often are the impacted. 
Severity is how bad is the issue compared to the Ideal. 
Loss = reach X frequency X severity."

Where your buyer is today: a problem.
Where your buyer wants to be tomorrow: a payoff.
The process to move them from problem to payoff.
This email uses your buyer’s words to play back these points, ensure they feel heard, and showcase their logic for why they should move forward with another call.

The four steps in the framework are:

1. A clear problem statement.
2. How they want to approach the problem.
3. What needs to be true of a solution for it to fit.
4. Next steps, referencing a colleague who’s impacted.

Here's how it reads:

< Prospect >, thanks for such an open, thoughtful conversation.
You shared that despite trying < failed solution >, your team still can't < desired outcome >.
That's because of < problem >, which is costing < cost of problem >, and it's getting worse.
You also felt the most effective way to go about solving this is < logical approach >.
But for this to work in your case, you need to ensure < key questions for demo >.
Looking forward to digging into this with < colleagues > on < demo date >.

```

### **💬 Why This Works**

* It mirrors what the buyer already said, ensuring they feel heard.

* It creates a logical case they can easily forward to others internally.

* It introduces urgency and consequence without feeling pushy.

### **🛠️ How to Experiment**

* Generate 2 versions: one “emotional” and one “logical” framing.

* Tell GPT to **minimize jargon** to make forwarding easier.

* Add a custom instruction to mirror the **buyer’s specific language** (e.g., if they said “sales productivity” don’t swap it for “efficiency”).

## **🔹 3\. Personalized Cold Outreach Email**

### **📜 Prompt**

`You are a senior sales development rep skilled in warm personalization.`    
`Craft a concise intro email (<120 words) based on the following data:`

`- {Prospect Job Title}`  
`- {Recent Company News / PR event}`  
`- {LinkedIn About section}`

`The email should:`  
`- Reference a specific news item or personal milestone.`  
`- Connect it back to a relevant business pain or opportunity.`  
`- Use a consultative, curious tone.`  
`- End with a simple CTA: \"Would you be open to a quick 10-min chat next week?\"`

`Avoid sounding scripted. Prioritize relevance over cleverness.`

### **💬 Why This Works**

* Modern buyers *sniff out* templated emails instantly.

* This structure immediately shows "you did your homework."

* A soft CTA reduces friction and boosts reply rates.

### **🛠️ How to Experiment**

* Test different tones: “helpful peer” vs. “trusted advisor” vs. “challenger.”

* Play with CTA styles: **“Quick chat?” vs. “Curious to hear your take?”**

* Add a **"fun fact"** hook to stand out even more if appropriate.

## **🔹 4\. Objection Handling Playbook Builder**

### **📜 Prompt**

`You are a Customer Success Manager skilled in objection handling.`    
`I will provide you a list of common objections below.`    
`For each objection:`

`- Draft 2 response variations: one formal, one casual.`  
`- The first sentence should mirror the buyer’s concern empathetically.`  
`- The second should reposition the objection toward our solution’s strengths.`  
`- Keep each response under 60 words.`

`Here are the objections: {Paste 5–10 FAQs / objections}`

### **💬 Why This Works**

* Salespeople struggle to improvise objection responses.

* Having prebuilt, voice-matched replies speeds up training and consistency.

* Different tone variations help depending on the buyer’s style.

---

## **🔹 5\. Post-Conference Mass Personalized Outreach**

### **📜 Prompt**

`You are a business development rep following up after an industry event.`    
`For each prospect I met, use the info below (business card notes, LinkedIn profile, event session attended) to:`

`- Write a personal follow-up email.`  
`- Reference something specific from our conversation.`  
`- Offer value first (e.g., an intro, resource, or idea).`  
`- End with a friendly CTA to reconnect next week.`

`Tone: warm, authentic, lightly professional.`

### **💬 Why This Works**

* Immediate, personalized follow-up after events massively improves engagement rates.

* Buyers remember you if you reference the conversation, not just a generic “great meeting you.”


Awesome – thanks for sharing your additional Clay prompts. These add a **powerful new layer** to the Starter Pack — focusing more on **scalable personalization and micro-targeting**, not just pre-call or follow-up.

Review the following information:  
1. My target prospect is a {Title}.

Determine what they sell.  
Identify the 3 most likely personas (seniority/job titles) their SDRs are targeting.  
Output only the list, comma-separated.  
Do not add commentary, numbers, or extra formatting.
```

### 💬 Why This Works

## 🔹 8. Personalized Email Using Base Template + Personas

### 📜 Prompt

```markdown
I will give you:  
1) My company's base email template

Write an email incorporating this information.  
~~~
Here is the email template: {Base Email Template}

- Liberal use of whitespace  
- No standard greetings like \"Hope you're well\"

- No quotation marks  
- Output only the email body; no subject line or signature
```

### 💬 Why This Works

- Reinforces only *one clear idea* per email — critical for cold outreach.

### 🛠️ How to Experiment
- Test longer emails vs. very short bursts (~50 words).
- Have GPT generate **two styles**: “neutral consultative” and “slightly provocative.”

---

## 🔹 7. Personalized Subject Line Creation

### 📜 Prompt

```markdown
You will write a subject line personalized for this recipient.  
~~~
Target Personas: {Target Personas Response}

Choose one persona and combine with these template forms:

Rules:  
- Max 40 characters  
- Pose it as a question  
- Avoid spammy words (no \"Curious\")  
- No quotation marks  
- Output ONLY the subject line
```

### 💬 Why This Works
- Makes subject lines **feel like a direct, open-ended question** — best for curiosity + click-through.

- Easy to mass-customize without losing quality.

### 🛠️ How to Experiment
- Rotate different starter verbs (“Meet vs. Intro vs. Connect”).
