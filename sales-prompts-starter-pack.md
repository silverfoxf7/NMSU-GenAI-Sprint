## **🔹 1\. Pre-Call Preparation Battlecard**

### **📜 Prompt**

```markdown
You are a top-performing sales development representative.
I am preparing for a meeting with {Prospect Name}, {Job Title at Company}.
Based on the information provided below (LinkedIn bio, company website, news articles), do the following:

- Summarize the top 3 likely pain points they face.
- Identify 2 insightful discovery questions I can ask during the call.
- Highlight 1 industry trend or company milestone I can mention to show relevance.

Use a professional, consultative tone in your output.
```

### **💬 Why This Works**

* Buyers appreciate when you show you understand them *before* the call even starts.

* It turns scattered research into a focused conversation plan.

* Asking better questions makes you stand out as a serious, prepared partner.

### **🛠️ How to Experiment**

* Try **swapping the tone**: warm and casual for startup founders; formal and sharp for enterprise.

* **Request 3 versions**: a conservative prep sheet, a creative version, and a “risky” version.

* Add a line asking for a **"cold open hook"** to kick off the meeting.

## **🔹 2\. Post-Meeting Follow-Up Email (Selling With Framework)**

### **📜 Prompt**

`You are an expert account executive specializing in consensus-driven sales.`    
`I will provide you with meeting notes below.`    
`Your task is to craft a follow-up email that:`

`- Plays back the buyer’s current challenge (Problem Statement).`  
`- Articulates the Cost and Consequences of inaction.`  
`- Frames the Logical Next Step (internal share, demo, second call).`  
`- References a key stakeholder who would benefit from moving forward.`

`Structure the problem using Nate Nasralla’s \"Selling With\" framework:`  
`- \"Every [frequency], at least [reach] face [pain], costing us [loss].\"`  
`- \"If not addressed by [timeline], then [implication].\"`

`Use a tone that is direct, professional, and highly buyer-centric.`

### **💬 Why This Works**

* It mirrors what the buyer already said, ensuring they feel heard.

* It creates a logical case they can easily forward to others internally.

* It introduces urgency and consequence without feeling pushy.

### **🛠️ How to Experiment**

* Generate 2 versions: one “emotional” and one “logical” framing.

* Tell GPT to **minimize jargon** to make forwarding easier.

* Add a custom instruction to mirror the **buyer’s specific language** (e.g., if they said “sales productivity” don’t swap it for “efficiency”).

## **🔹 3\. Personalized Cold Outreach Email**

### **📜 Prompt**

`You are a senior sales development rep skilled in warm personalization.`    
`Craft a concise intro email (<120 words) based on the following data:`

`- {Prospect Job Title}`  
`- {Recent Company News / PR event}`  
`- {LinkedIn About section}`

`The email should:`  
`- Reference a specific news item or personal milestone.`  
`- Connect it back to a relevant business pain or opportunity.`  
`- Use a consultative, curious tone.`  
`- End with a simple CTA: \"Would you be open to a quick 10-min chat next week?\"`

`Avoid sounding scripted. Prioritize relevance over cleverness.`

### **💬 Why This Works**

* Modern buyers *sniff out* templated emails instantly.

* This structure immediately shows "you did your homework."

* A soft CTA reduces friction and boosts reply rates.

### **🛠️ How to Experiment**

* Test different tones: “helpful peer” vs. “trusted advisor” vs. “challenger.”

* Play with CTA styles: **“Quick chat?” vs. “Curious to hear your take?”**

* Add a **"fun fact"** hook to stand out even more if appropriate.

## **🔹 4\. Objection Handling Playbook Builder**

### **📜 Prompt**

`You are a Customer Success Manager skilled in objection handling.`    
`I will provide you a list of common objections below.`    
`For each objection:`

`- Draft 2 response variations: one formal, one casual.`  
`- The first sentence should mirror the buyer’s concern empathetically.`  
`- The second should reposition the objection toward our solution’s strengths.`  
`- Keep each response under 60 words.`

`Here are the objections: {Paste 5–10 FAQs / objections}`

### **💬 Why This Works**

* Salespeople struggle to improvise objection responses.

* Having prebuilt, voice-matched replies speeds up training and consistency.

* Different tone variations help depending on the buyer’s style.

---

## **🔹 5\. Post-Conference Mass Personalized Outreach**

### **📜 Prompt**

`You are a business development rep following up after an industry event.`    
`For each prospect I met, use the info below (business card notes, LinkedIn profile, event session attended) to:`

`- Write a personal follow-up email.`  
`- Reference something specific from our conversation.`  
`- Offer value first (e.g., an intro, resource, or idea).`  
`- End with a friendly CTA to reconnect next week.`

`Tone: warm, authentic, lightly professional.`

### **💬 Why This Works**

* Immediate, personalized follow-up after events massively improves engagement rates.

* Buyers remember you if you reference the conversation, not just a generic “great meeting you.”


Awesome – thanks for sharing your additional Clay prompts. These add a **powerful new layer** to the Starter Pack — focusing more on **scalable personalization and micro-targeting**, not just pre-call or follow-up.

## 🔹 6. JTBD Value Proposition One-Liner

### 📜 Prompt

```markdown
Review the following information:  
1. My target prospect is a {Title}.  
2. My company offers these value propositions: {My Value Props}  

Now draft a short, one-liner that conveys how {my company} can help with my prospect's jobs, pains, or gains.  
- Do not directly accuse the prospect of \"rejection fatigue.\"  
- Be empathetic and supportive.  
- No quotation marks.  
- Use consistent abbreviations for \"SDR\" and \"BDR.\"  
```

### 💬 Why This Works
- Distills your offer into one empathetic, relevant line.

- You control tone: no aggressive or presumptive framing.

### 🛠️ How to Experiment

## 🔹 7. Target Persona Identification (Site Intelligence)

### 📜 Prompt

```markdown
Visit {Company Website}.  
Determine what they sell.  
Identify the 3 most likely personas (seniority/job titles) their SDRs are targeting.  
Output only the list, comma-separated.  
Do not add commentary, numbers, or extra formatting.
```

### 💬 Why This Works
- Perfect for outbound targeting and list building.
- Helps you tailor messaging to *who your buyer cares about*, not just to the buyer themselves.

### 🛠️ How to Experiment
- Cross-reference persona guesses with LinkedIn Job Titles.
- Train the AI to suggest **buyer pains** associated with those personas.

## 🔹 8. Personalized Email Using Base Template + Personas

### 📜 Prompt

```markdown
I will give you:  
1) My company's base email template  
2) Personas my prospect is targeting  
3) A value proposition from {my company}  

Write an email incorporating this information.  
~~~
Here is the email template: {Base Email Template}  
Here are the target personas: {Target Personas Response}  
Here is {my company}'s value proposition: {JTBD Value Prop One-Liner Response}  
~~~
Rules:  
- Friendly, conversational tone (<100 words)  
- Liberal use of whitespace  
- No standard greetings like \"Hope you're well\"  
- No numbered lists  
- No quotation marks  
- Output only the email body; no subject line or signature
```

### 💬 Why This Works
- Embeds genuine personalization based on the buyer’s world.
- Feels human, but can be automated at scale.
- Reinforces only *one clear idea* per email — critical for cold outreach.

### 🛠️ How to Experiment
- Test longer emails vs. very short bursts (~50 words).
- Have GPT generate **two styles**: “neutral consultative” and “slightly provocative.”

## 🔹 7. Personalized Subject Line Creation

### 📜 Prompt

```markdown
You will write a subject line personalized for this recipient.  
~~~
Target Personas: {Target Personas Response}  
~~~
Choose one persona and combine with these template forms:
- [persona]?
- meet [persona]?
- intro x [persona]?

Rules:  
- Max 40 characters  
- Pose it as a question  
- Avoid spammy words (no \"Curious\")  
- No quotation marks  
- Output ONLY the subject line
```

### 💬 Why This Works
- Makes subject lines **feel like a direct, open-ended question** — best for curiosity + click-through.
- Keeps structure simple, clean, scalable.
- Easy to mass-customize without losing quality.

### 🛠️ How to Experiment
- Rotate different starter verbs (“Meet vs. Intro vs. Connect”).
- Test against more traditional sales subject lines for open rate improvement.
